Go Mock Demo
============

Use [gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock) to generate mocks for testing

```
brew install go
go get
```

Run all tests:

```
go test ./...
```

Or just test tests inside `hello`

```
go test ./hello
```

Notice
------

The mock file `mock/mock_hello/mock_Taler.go` is generated by command:

```
mockgen -source=hello/hello.go > mock/mock_hello/mock_Talker.go
```
